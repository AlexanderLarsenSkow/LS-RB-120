Okay: History class.

We want to keep track of the history of moves from the computer and the player.
So, in essence, we need a data structure that's held in an instance variable within the class.

Something like:

{
  human: [all moves]
  computer: [all moves]
}

or we could do two different arrays.

I think the hash probably makes more sense. Then we can output the entire history with the to_s method, which
  just outputs the array joined together with commas between each entry.

Add to the array with every move cycle.

Also ask the user if they want to display the move history after every turn.
Where should this display method be? history class or Human class?
