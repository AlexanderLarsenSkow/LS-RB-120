Planning for Moves sub classes

Each move gets its own subclass and < and > methods

computer chooses from an array of moves objects

player chooses a string input that... corresponds to one of the objects... hmm.
I wonder if there's a certain data structure I could use here.
So in the current version, we get the string from the user and that determines what kind of move it is in the Move class.

But this time, we want to input something: 'r' 'rock' for rock.new
's' 'scissors' for scissors.new
etc.

We could create a new data structure where an array points at the new move object.

{
 's' => scissors.new
}

The other issue is: where does this object live? oh no. It can't live in the Move class because it's the super class.

{
 ['s', 'scissors'] => Scissors.new
}
