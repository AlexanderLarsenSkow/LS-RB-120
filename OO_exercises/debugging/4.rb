# In the `Employee` class, the getter method for the `serial_number` instance variable is defined as private
# with method access contorl. However, in the custom `==` instance method for the class, the getter method for
# this instance variable is used to comapre with another `Employee` object's `serial_number`. We cannot do this 
# with `private` methods; we can only do this by either making the getter method `public` or by making it `protected`,
# which prevents us from accecssing the method outside the class but allows us to compare with other objects from the same class.
