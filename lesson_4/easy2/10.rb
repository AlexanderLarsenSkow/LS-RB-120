# What are the Benefits of Object Oriented Programming in Ruby?

# One extreme benefit is encapsulation. We can provide and limit access to different states and behaviors to different objects
# that we might not want to access those things in our programs.

# Another benefit would be the ease of use of instantiating objects: They share the same behaviors and don't require new behavioral 
# definitions, they inherit the exact same behavior from their class definitions. This provides cleaner code in a lot of respects
# where the creation of new objects is quite simple.

# A third benefit would be polymorphism, the idea of overriding methods of the same name further up the lookup chain path and 
# providing different behavior and implementation in the pursuit of similar goals. 

# What LS said:
  # Creating objects lets you think mroe abstractly about the code.
  # objects represented as nouns are easier to conceptualize.
  # expose functionality to the pieces of code that need it: encapsulation
  # give functionality to different parts of a program without duplicating it. my second benefit.
  # We can build apps faster as we can re-use pre-written code.
  # As teh software becomes more complex we can better manage its complexity.
